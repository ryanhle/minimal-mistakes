## What are your expectations of the class?
I feel like this class will be OOP with JavaScript, Python, and big groups. I think I'll learn that Python is more than a typeless abomination. I hope to learn a lot more about software development and its ensemble of associated tools and techniques.

## What did you do this past week?
I found my classes on time! I have two in the stadium and I had an interesting time trying to get around in there. I spent more on textbooks than I ever have before. One class requires we have the books in class and prohibits electronics. Another requires an access code in the book.

## What's in your way?
I still have to get more books. When I last went to the Co-op, they had a sign up saying the books were delayed again because of the hurricane.

## What will you do next week?
Next week, I will make another attempt at the bookstore. I will try to get my academic life sorted out. Even though I made it to my classes, I'm not entirely sure what I'm enrolled in or their expectations. I will try to do my assigned readings. So many classes have assigned multiple chapters. I'm not sure I can get through them all. I also need to get a professional photo. 

## What's my experience of the class?
So far, it's alright. I'm not thrown off by the professor's teaching style this year. He'll call on someone and have "conversations" about the material. I think it's rather curious, but fine. The first full day of lecture felt a whole like the first full day of OOP, but with Python. My friends have told me they're nearly the same until the second project.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
I really like vim bindings in GitHub's Atom editor. You can get them through a plugin and do the convenient vim things with a nice GUI.
