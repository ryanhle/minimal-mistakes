## What did you do this past week?
Last week, I learned a whole bunch about databases. Mainly, I learned I know hardly anything about databases and they're much more than a fancy way to store things in a file. It's rather strange. We've just finished our fourth week, but I don't remember feeling that time passing. All of these moments are just slipping past.

I took a Brit Lit exam last Tuesday and didn't Q drop the class. I hope time will show that was because I knew I did well rather than really hoping I wouldn't have to take the course again.

## What's in your way?
Perhaps I should do the reading on refactoring, given that we're starting to discuss the subject in class. It feels so contrived though. 'Let's take this idea and dress it up with a fancy name so we look clever.' I suppose having standardized terms gives increased clarity and decreased length. Oh good, that's just like refactoring.

## What will you do next week?
Next week, I, with my group, will attempt to get as much of the project done as possible so we don't have to panic and work over the break.

## What's my experience of the class?
My experience for the past week was rather unremarkable. I think it's my fault rather than the professor's, though. I feel like I'm wandering from class to class in this weird haze. Anyways, I don't think I dropped the ball on anything so I think everything is fine for now.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
Have y'all heard of [semistandard](https://github.com/Flet/semistandard)? It's this lovely linter and formatter that will take all of your JavaScript and apply a style to it. I have no idea about its rules about spacing and such and I really don't care. It just makes everything uniform. I open up a terminal, type `semistandard -- fix`, and all of the code looks the same. It does some other cool stuff, but this is the biggest selling point for me.
