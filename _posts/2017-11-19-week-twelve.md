## What did you do this past week?
Last week, I started refactoring our project! It seems like a whole bunch of "we'll fix it later" kinda things snuck into our code along with a whole bunch of repetition. Clean code is happy code! Soon, our code will be happy.

We also had an interesting lecture on ethics. I do wish I got to take a proper course focused on ethics. Computer Science has affects on so many fields and will have impacts on so many more in the future. I think it's important that we are able to make ethical choices in the software we develop. The motto of tech is move fast and break things, but are we leaving a positive impact? Do we fix what we break? Some decisions I see seem super sketchy.

## What's in your way?
The Thanksgiving game. I'm not really looking forward to interrupting the break with a football game. But, I guess I should be used to it by now.

Also, I haven't read A Tale of Two Cities for Brit Lit. It's a really big book and I don't imagine I can cram the whole thing the night before the test.

## What will you do next week?
Next week, I'll try to make the code a bit better and do a whole bunch of readings I skipped.

## What's my experience of the class?
It's alright. I think I've just become a jaded fourth year and want to be over university.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
Atom released this cool looking thing called [teletype](https://teletype.atom.io/). You get to share the code you're working on with other people and everyone can make changes at the same time.
