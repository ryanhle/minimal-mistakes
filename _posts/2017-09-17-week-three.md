## What did you do this past week?
I think the highlight of last week was painting a bird house. I was running around thinking about music pass offs, the career fair, and pretending to be a competent proctor. Then, I saw these nice people from HomeAway in the GDC. They asked if I wanted to paint a bird house. I had a lovely hour playing with paint and chatting with random people instead of dealing with anything else.

I guess I did other things too. I tried the /convince people to hire me/ thing. I turned in Collatz. I hope I did it right ðŸ˜Ÿ I read *most* of my assigned readings.

## What's in your way?
I don't think there's too much. I need to catch up on readings. That should be it.

## What will you do next week?
I'm not really sure. I think we get assigned the next project and maybe groups. That will be fun.

## What's my experience of the class?
The class is still a lot like OOP. L-values and R-values, various data structures, and exceptions all happened in OOP. I'm learning about them again with a cute little Python twist.

I'm having a slight struggle taking the daily quizzes. The wifi seems a bit difficult to connect to. I'm not sure if it's me, my laptop, or the room. So far, everything works with enough time to spare to take the quiz, but it causes some unneeded anxiety.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
The Fine Arts Library is a cool place to work or study. It's rather pretty and doesn't have that air of sadness like the PCL. I suppose it's a bit out of the way from the main part of campus, but that just means there are less people to take your spot!
